CHANGE LOG
--------------------

2008-1-2 [Coolite]
1.  Added .toISOString() to sugarpak.js. Returns ISO 8601 formatted string of date.
2.  Changed .toJSONString() to return string value wrapped in double-quotes ("") as per
    JSON.org spec. 
   
    If you want an ISO/JSON date formatted string WITHOUT the double-quotes, please pass 
    a format to the .toString() function.
   
    Example
   
    new Date().toString("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ");
   
3.  Fixed bug where Date.parse("monday") was not returning correct year when the current
    week overlapped the end of year.
4.  Fixed bug in .parseExact() where day was being initialized to '1' if no day was present in the date string.
    This was a problem when only parsing a Time.
5.  New tests added to /test/parseExact/.
6.  Found and fixed bug where if a string to be parsed was a digit with a trailing space.

    Example
    
    // Old
    Date.parse("5 "); // returned current day at 5 AM. Wrong.
    
    // New
    Date.parse("5 "); // return 5th day of current month. Correct.
    
    Just trimming whitespace before sending string into parser fixed the problem.

2007-12-27 [Coolite]
1.  Modified the offset values of Date.CultureInfo.timezones.
2.  Added <static> Date.compare(date1, date2).
        
        Example
        
        var date1 = Date.today();
        var date2 = Date.today().add(1).day();
        
        Date.compare(date1, date2); // returns -1

3.  Added <static> Date.equals(date1, date2).        

        Example
        
        var date1 = Date.today();
        var date2 = Date.today().add(1).day();
        
        Date.equals(date1, date2); // returns false

4.  Fixed bug in Date.getDayNumberFromName() where it was not checking against the Date.CultureInfo.shortestDayNames array.
5.  Removed <static> Date.getDayName(dayOfWeek). Please use Date.CultureInfo.dayNames[dayOfWeek]. Other options include:
        Date.CultureInfo.dayNames[dayOfWeek]
        Date.CultureInfo.abbreviatedDayNames[dayOfWeek]
        Date.CultureInfo.shortestDayNames[dayOfWeek]

    If you have a Date instance, please use .toString().
        
        Example
        
        Date.today().toString("dddd"); // "Thursday"
        Date.today().toString("ddd"); // "Thu"
        
5.  Removed <static> Date.getMonthName(month). Please use Date.CultureInfo.monthNames[month]. 
    Other options include:
        Date.CultureInfo.monthNames[month]
        Date.CultureInfo.abbreviatedMonthNames[month]

    If you have a Date instance, please use .toString().
        
        Example
        
        Date.today().toString("MMMM"); // "December"
        Date.today().toString("MMM"); // "Dec"

6.  Added Date.prototype.hasDaylightSavingTime(). 
    Returns a boolean value indicating whether Daylight Saving Time is observed in the current time zone.
7.  Added Date.prototype.isDaylightSavingTime(). 
    Returns a boolean value indicating whether this Date instance is within the Daylight Saving Time range for the current time zone.
8.  Verified core.js, sugarpak.js, and time.js are passing JSLint (http://www.jslint/) in "Strict whitespace" mode.
